1.
a method that returns the sum of two integers

Given two integers
save the first integer into a variable number1
save the second integer into a variable number2
add number1 + number2 and save it into a variable result
Print out the result

START
# given 2 integers
  SET number1 = first integer
  SET number2 = second integer

  result = number1 + number2

  PRINT result
END


2.
a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

Given a collection of strings
Initialize an empty container for the result called 'result'
Iterate over the collection
for each string in the collection add the string to 'result'
return 'result'


START
  # Given a collection of strings
  SET result = ""
  FOR EACH string in the strings collection
    result << string

  PRINT result
END


3.
a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

Given an array of integers
Initialize an empty array named "result"
Iterate through the collection
  - if the index of the element in the collection is an even number
    add the element to the "result"
  - otherwise
    skip the element in the collection and go to the next element
Print out the result

START
  # Given a collection of integers named "numbers"
  SET result = empty array
  FOR EACH number in the "numbers" collection
    IF index of number is even?
      result << number
    ELSE
      next

  PRINT result
END
