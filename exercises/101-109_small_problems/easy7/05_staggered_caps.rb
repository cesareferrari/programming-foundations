# Write a method that takes a String as an argument, and returns a new String
# that contains the original value using a staggered capitalization scheme in
# which every other character is capitalized, and the remaining characters are
# lowercase. Characters that are not letters should not be changed, but count
# as characters when switching between upper and lowercase.
