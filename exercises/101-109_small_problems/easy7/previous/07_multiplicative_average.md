Write a method that takes an Array of integers as input, multiplies all
of the numbers together, divides the result by the number of entries in
the Array, and then prints the result rounded to 3 decimal places.

Input: array of integers
Output: float

Rules:
 multiply all numbers
 divide result by array length
 return result rounded to 3 decimals

Algorithm:

array reduce by *
divide by array length
convert to float
round to 3 decimals


Examples

show_multiplicative_average([3, 5])
The result is 7.500

show_multiplicative_average([2, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17])
The result is 28361.667
