Easy 4 exercises. Practice on those using the problem solving method and try to solve each exercise within 20-30 minutes.


Learning methods
------------------------
Learn methods for:
  - String
  - Array
  - Hash
  - Enumerable

What does it mean?
Be able to tell what all the methods are for one of those four classes and
explain what they do. 90% of the method is probably considered a good number to
know. So, I need to know 90% of the methods by heart for each class.


String methods

Class methods

1. String.new('Hello world')

This is a class method. Returns the string passed as the argument.

2. String.try_convert(object)
Returns the object passed as an argument as a string if it can be converted. If it cannot be converted, it return nil.
It uses to_str to convert.

For example:

3.to_str returns 'Undefined method to_str for 1:Fixnum'
Means that it's a number and there is no to_str method defined for it.

3.to_s will return '3' (as a string). Means that to_s is defined for Fixnum.

Calling String.try_convert(3) will return nil, because it tries to use to_str but since the method is not defined for Fixnum it will return nil instead of an exception.

So, try_convert is like using to_str but without returning an exception if the conversion cannot be done.
