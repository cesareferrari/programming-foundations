# Pseudo Code #

Example of pseudo code

```
Given a collection of integers.

Iterate through the collection one by one
  - save the first value as the starting value.
  - for each iteration, compare the current value to the saved value
  - if the saved value is greater or the same
    - move to the next value in the collection
  - otherwise if the current value is greater
    - reassign the saved value as the current value

After iterating through the collection, return the saved value.
